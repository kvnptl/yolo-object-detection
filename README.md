- Contains jupyter notebook for training and inferencing
- Train on single or multiple GPUs
- Export trained model to ONNX, TensorRT, CoreML, OpenVINO, TFLite

# How to run a jupyter notebook (Yolov7):

- Open `object_recognition_YOLOv7_ss22_local_competition.ipynb` and download the dataset from the given link
- Modify `dataset_ss22_v4_yolov7.yaml` as per the dataset
- Set training arguments as mentioned in the notebook
